Released on 2016-11-27. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.1.1)

#### Fixed

#### Updated
- Tests to be run using `swift test` when loading as a Swift Package [PR [#228](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/228)]

---

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/releases/tag/1.1.0)
Released on 2016-10-25. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.1.0)

#### Reintrocued
- Nested keypaths feature [PR [#225](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/225)]

#### Added
- Support for de/encoding UUID types [PR [#226](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/226)]

---

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/releases/tag/1.0.0)
Released on 2016-09-20. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0.0)

#### Updated
- JSON typealias now uses Any instead of AnyObject [Issue [#212](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/212)]
- Support for Swift 3.0 [PR [#212](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/214)]
- Syntax now reflects Swift 3.0 standards [PR [#216](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/216)]

#### Upgrade Notes

This version marks the first version using Swift 3.0 syntax. Users should update client projects to Swift 3.0 before switching to `1.0.0`

Also note: Version `0.8.0` marked the deprecation of a feature called "nested keypaths". This allowed deeply nested JSON values to be accessed via a period-delimited key. However, this feature was reintroduced in version 1.1.0.

---

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/releases/tag/0.8.0)
Released on 2016-09-20. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A0.8.0)

#### Deprecated
- The "nested keypaths" feature has been removed as it caused a runtime crash for the Release configuration (Issue [#135](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues/135))

#### Updated
- Array decoding now returns `nil` if any decodings fail instead of a partial array of decoded values (Issue [#189](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/issues/189))
- Support for Swift 2.3 [PR [#209](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss/pull/209)]

#### Upgrade Notes

This version marks the deprecation of a feature called "nested keypaths". This allowed deeply nested JSON values to be accessed via a period-delimited key. However, it caused a runtime crash when using the Release configuration in prior version (see [Nested Keypaths Deprecation](https://github.com/hkellaway/Gloss#nested-keypaths-deprecation). However, this feature was reintroduced in version 1.1.0.

Also note: this version marks the last that will use Swift 2.x syntax. Version `1.0.0` will support Swift 3.0 and any improvements to Gloss thereafter will use Swift 3.0 syntax.
